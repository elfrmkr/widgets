This project includes four widgets.

Accordion: Components expand to show their context when clicked.
Search: Shows wikipedia results for the looked terms and allow users to go the actual page by clicking buttons availabe for each article.
Dropdown: Allows you to select components for later use and able to change them if it is wanted.
Translate: Allows you to enter a text and select a language to translate and shows the output.



### Note
The API key for the translate widget will not work inside the published site because it is available for specifically localhost:3000 (it will only work in your code editor).
